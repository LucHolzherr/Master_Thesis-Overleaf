I want to thank all persons involved in my master thesis. Special thanks goes to my supervisors 	
Michel Breyer, Julian FÃ¶rster and  Dr. Jen Jen Chung for their time and effort in coaching me through the past six months. Thank you for enduring my way to detailed explanations and elaborations in the weekly meeting. Your expertise and motivation kept me on the right track through this project. Last but not least I want to thank Prof. Dr. Roland Siegwart for making this project possible.
